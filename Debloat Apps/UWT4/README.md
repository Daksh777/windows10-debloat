This tweaker is just around 750 KB in size and includes over 200 tweaks. Like its predecessors, UWT 4.0 sports a clean, minimalistic UI, offering links in the left panel, and tabs on the top, in some categories. Hover over any tweak, and helpful tooltips will tell you what the tweak does.

## Tweak Information
- **System Information:** When you open UWT4 you will get to see some basic information about your system like Operating system version, Build, System Type, Processor, Installed RAM, Computer name, User name, and the WEI Score, etc. You also have buttons to open Recovery Options, run DISM, run the System File Checker or create a System Restore Point.

- **Customization:** Under this category, you will be able to tweak settings of your Taskbar, Thumbnails, File Explorer, and the Modern UI. You can opt to use a Light or Dark theme for OS or apps, disable Start animations, use default or change Battery Date & Time flyouts or change the Volume Control, show or hide Frequent folders or Recent files, etc.

- **User Accounts:** Under the User Accounts tab, you will be able to change your User Account settings, Logon information, and sign-in options. You can also change the User Account Control settings here.

- **Performance tweaks:** The Performance tab offers tweaks to optimize Windows 10 to best suit your requirements. While most of these settings are best left at their default values, this panel gives you quick access to change them, should you wish to.

- **Security tweaks:** Harden your Windows 10 by changing some settings. If you want to restrict access to some Control Panel applets like Windows Updates you can do so easily. There is a new Privacy tab, where you change Windows 10 Privacy settings and disable Telemetry, Biometrics, Advertising ID, Bing search, Cortana, Windows Update sharing, Feedback requests, Password Reveal button, Steps Recorder, Inventory Collector, disable Wi-Fi Sense and Application Telemetry.

- **Internet Explorer:** Tweak your Internet Explorer 11 when you open this section. Tweak IEâ€™s appearance and behavior.

- **Context Menu tweaks:** Add Windows Store apps, features, and useful functions to the right-click context menu. Add Scan with Windows Defender, Clear Clipboard, all built-in default Windows Store apps and more to the context menu.

- **Additional system tweaks:** Under this category, you will see some additional system and Network tweaks. You can also set UWT to behave the way you want it too. By default, when you apply a tweak and click Apply, UWT4 will automatically restart explorer.exe to apply the tweak. Change its behavior if you wish.

- **Search Bar:** Ultimate Windows Tweaker 4 adds a Search Bar. Bow you can easily search for tweaks, and then double-click on the search result to go to it directly.

- **About tab:** Here apart from the License Agreement, you will see some useful links. If you need to submit bugs, visit the About page and use the Submit Bugs link. If you need support, you can use the Support link or visit our TWC Forum. Clicking on the Check for Update button will inform you if any updates are available. You can then visit the homepage to download the latest version.
