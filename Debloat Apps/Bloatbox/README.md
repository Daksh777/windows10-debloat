## About

I know there are a thousand ways to uninstall modern Windows 10 apps. Here is the One Thousand and One with Bloatbox!
This was intended as a small extension for my app [Privatezilla](https://github.com/builtbybel/privatezilla) to uninstall specific apps. 
Since I didn't want to bloat Privatezilla unnecessarily (those who know me know that I am a friend of small apps and lean code), I have now made this available as a standalone app. 

This code is based on parts of this nice project from [ConditionalException](https://github.com/ConditionalException/Windows10Privacy). Some inspiration has also flowed from this ugly guy [AppManager by Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/p/app/9n8b6qf719pt) but on Windows Forms :smirk:

## Download

- (Latest release) [Download](https://github.com/builtbybel/bloatbox/releases)
- (Mirror on my site) [Download](https://www.builtbybel.com/bloatbox)

## Community package
The community package for Bloatbox adds support for several advanced scripting features based upon PowerShell, e.g.
- Reinstall of all built-in apps
- Removal of specific pre-installed apps
- Uninstall of OneDrive 
- Unpinning Startmenu tiles 
- Disable of Windows Defender (NOT recommended! I can highly recommend using Windows Defender on consumer versions of Windows 10)
- Blocking telemetry via firewall and host files. Rules are provided by [crazy-max/WindowsSpyBlocker](https://github.com/crazy-max/WindowsSpyBlocker)
			  
#### Check also the [Marketplace for new script files](https://github.com/builtbybel/bloatbox/tree/master/marketplace)
Script files provided for [Privatezilla](https://github.com/builtbybel/privatezilla) or my older app SharpApp are fully compatible with Bloatbox. You will find some on my site [here](https://www.builtbybel.com/marketplace)

All scripts included to the latest package can be viewed [here](https://github.com/builtbybel/bloatbox/tree/master/marketplace)
