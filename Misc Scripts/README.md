### All the files in this repository are untouched/unmodifed by me and are safe. <br> **If you are prompted with a false positive, please do not open an issue here but instead in their respectve repositories or websites.** <br> VT link: https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/057991db404ed863e2007c75e4455e2e5718082ae98d0644cab9112f964468f8/detection
 * ### Note: The detections are false positives. The only thing being flagged is [Windows 10 Activate.bat](https://github.com/Daksh777/windows10-debloat/blob/master/Misc%20Scripts/Windows%2010%20Activate/activate.bat) which uses KMS to activate Windows. You can check the script and ensure that there is nothing malicious.
