 * ### Note: The detections are false positives. The only thing being flagged is [Windows 10 Activate.bat](https://github.com/Daksh777/windows10-debloat/blob/master/Misc%20Scripts/Windows%2010%20Activate/activate.bat) which uses KMS to activate Windows. You can check the script and ensure that there is nothing malicious.
